## 🚀 Quick Start

### Recommended: VPS one-liner (Pull & Run)

Build runs on GitHub Actions → GHCR. Low-spec VPS only pulls and runs:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/witguang/vsm/main/vps-deploy.sh | sudo bash
```

Update:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/witguang/vsm/main/vps-deploy.sh | sudo bash -s -- update
```

Images:

- `ghcr.io/witguang/015:latest`
- `ghcr.io/witguang/015-worker:latest`

Deploy toolkit: [witguang/vsm](https://github.com/witguang/vsm)

### Docker Compose (manual)

1. Download `config.example.yaml` and `docker-compose.yml` (optional `.env.example` → `.env`)
2. Copy to `config.yaml` and set `download_secret`, `password_salt`, `site.url`
3. `mkdir -p uploads && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
4. Open `http://localhost:10015` (default `APP_PORT`)

### Per-VPS runtime branding

The image never rewrites compiled Nuxt files. Frontend values use Nuxt Runtime Config through `NUXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_LINK` and `NUXT_PUBLIC_COPYRIGHT`; administrator, storage, and image values use the backend's native Viper environment overrides. Set the source variables `SITE_ADMIN_NAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `STORAGE_LIMIT`, `CUSTOM_LINK`, and `COPYRIGHT` in Compose to reuse one image across VPS instances.

Repository-owned images must be committed at the exact paths `front/public/logo.png`, `front/public/background.jpg`, and `front/public/welcome.jpg`. Nuxt publishes them as `/logo.png`, `/background.jpg`, and `/welcome.jpg`. The image startup command detects the two optional JPG files and enables them automatically; no per-VPS image variables or mounts are required.

## 🔧 Development Guide

### Code Standards

- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Use Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checking
- Follow TypeScript type safety standards

### Commit Standards

```bash
# Code formatting will run automatically before commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build frontend
cd front && pnpm run build

# Build backend (requires Go environment)
cd backend && go build -o main .
